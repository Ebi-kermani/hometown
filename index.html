            <h2>About Tehran</h2>
            <p>Tehran, the capital of Iran, has a rich and varied history that spans several centuries. Its origins can be traced back to the Neolithic era, but it remained a small village until the 13th century. By the late 18th century, it gained significance when Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, declared Tehran as the capital of Persia in 1796. The city's strategic location, near the ancient city of Ray, made it an ideal choice for the Qajar rulers.</p>
            <p>Under Qajar rule, Tehran grew rapidly, becoming the political and economic hub of Iran. The city expanded during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi, who modernized Tehran by introducing Western-style architecture and infrastructure. The Pahlavi dynasty continued this modernization process, and Tehran became a center of cultural and social change.</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, Tehran played a crucial role in Iran's political history, especially during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which saw the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic. Since then, Tehran has grown into a bustling metropolis and a symbol of Iran's contemporary culture, politics, and economy. Today, it remains one of the largest and most influential cities in the Middle East.</p>
